# SA-methods
A repository for code from my Masters thesis project, comparing different sentiment analysis methods

This repository is intended to publish the core of the code I utilised for my Masters thesis project, "Comparative Evaluation of Sentiment Analysis Methods".

In it, I constructed a rule-based system and a simplistic word counter system, as well as making use of a BERT implementation as a neural network.

The notebook included here is a modified version of the one used throughout the project. It has been tidied up, removing older versions, as well as anything specific to my exact files and scraping efforts (or replacing them with generic text you can replace as needed).

Various elements may need to be customised to suit your own needs, but the core of the work should be there for scraping a corpus, cleaning it up, and running it through the systems.

Note that BERT was run with an external script, and the method utilised here may not work without that script or something emulating it.
